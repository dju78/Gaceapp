## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Supabase account (free tier works)
- Modern web browser

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dju78/gace.git
cd gace
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

#### a. Create a Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Note your Project URL and API keys

#### b. Run Database Setup
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql`
2. Copy the contents of `/supabase/setup.sql`
3. Paste and run the script
4. Verify tables are created (should see: `user_profiles`, `assets`, `documents`, `tax_calculations`, `compliance_alerts`)

#### c. Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Deploy the server function
supabase functions deploy server
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Update `/utils/supabase/info.tsx` with your Supabase credentials:

```typescript
export const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";
export const publicAnonKey = "YOUR_ANON_KEY";
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## 🎨 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS 4.0** - Styling with custom design tokens
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **Motion (Framer Motion)** - Animations
- **Lucide React** - Icons
- **Sonner** - Toast notifications

### Backend
- **Supabase** - Database, auth, storage, edge functions
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database with RLS
- **Hono** - Fast web framework for edge functions
- **Deno** - Secure TypeScript runtime for edge functions

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** - Database-level access control
- **Service Role Key** - Backend-only for privileged operations
- **Protected Routes** - Frontend route guards
- **CORS Configuration** - Proper cross-origin security
- **Password Authentication** - Supabase Auth integration

### Public vs. Private Credentials

This application follows Supabase's security model:

**Public (Safe for Client-Side):**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` - The Supabase project identifier
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - The public anonymous key (has RLS restrictions)

These are intentionally exposed in the client-side code and are safe to include in version control.

**Private (Server-Side Only):**
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Full database access (bypasses RLS)
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL` - Direct database connection string

These are stored in Netlify/Supabase environment variables and never exposed to clients.

For more information, see [Supabase API Keys Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys).

## 🧪 Testing

### Demo Credentials
The login page displays demo credentials for testing (if seeded).

### Manual Testing
1. **Sign Up Flow**: Create account → Complete onboarding → Access dashboard
2. **Asset Management**: Add/edit/delete assets → View analytics
3. **Tax Calculator**: Input income → Calculate tax → View DTA relief
4. **Document Upload**: Upload file → Process OCR → View extracted data
5. **Compliance Alerts**: View notifications → Mark as read/resolved

## 🚢 Deployment

### Figma Make (Current Environment)
The application is currently running in Figma Make and is ready for testing.

### Deploy to Vercel (Production)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# - SUPABASE_URL
# - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### Deploy to Netlify
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Table not found" error
**Solution**: Run the SQL setup script in Supabase SQL Editor (`/supabase/setup.sql`)

### "RLS policy violation" error
**Solution**: This should be fixed! The server uses service role key to bypass RLS for profile creation.

### "Profile already exists" error
**Solution**: This is now handled gracefully. If you see this, the email is already registered - please sign in instead.

### Edge Functions not working
**Solution**: Make sure to deploy the server function:
```bash
supabase functions deploy server
```

### Authentication issues
**Solution**: Check that your Supabase project credentials in `/utils/supabase/info.tsx` are correct.
